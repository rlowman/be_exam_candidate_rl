# SCOIR Technical Interview for Back-End Engineers
This repo contains an exercise intended for Back-End Engineers.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repo.
1. Using technology of your choice, complete [the assignment](./Assignment.md).
1. Update this README with
    * a `How-To` section containing any instructions needed to execute your program.
    * an `Assumptions` section containing documentation on any assumptions made while interpreting the requirements.
1. Before the deadline, submit a pull request with your solution.

## Expectations
1. Please take no more than 8 hours to work on this exercise. Complete as much as possible and then submit your solution.
1. This exercise is meant to showcase how you work. With consideration to the time limit, do your best to treat it like a production system.

## How-To
This project was written in Python 3 (Python 3.5.2 to be exact), and since this is command-line based program the initial
start to this script will require the python3 command. The main script is located in the src directory of this repository,
so before running this script make sure you are in the proper directory. Once in this directory, call the command 

python3 main.py * `input-directory` `output-directory` `error-directory`

I would like to point out that the arguments for the three directories must be the full path or this script will not work 
(you can use the short-cuts . .. also if one of the directories is the current or parent directories). One feature I wish I
could have added would be a kill feature, as this script will run forever. So the only way to stop this script is to manually
kill it from the command-line. 

## Assumptions 
1. Python 3 or later
